# Facial_Recognition

Deep Learning course project (Brenton Arnaboldi, Seda Bilaloglu, and Akash Kadel).

Our project seeks to predict facial expressions from 48 x 48 grayscale images. The emotions we will try to predict are: 1) Angry, 2) Disgust, 3) Fear, 4) Happy, 5) Sad, 6) Surprise, and 6) Neutral.

The notebook "pilot.ipynb" includes a preliminary CNN model, while the notebook "Cleaning_SimpleModel.ipynb" includes a basic feed-forward neural network. More models to come.
